# Author Rewards

Below you'll find details on the various rewards associated with being a CodeCollection author in our community!

### Bounties

While the royalty payments are the primary focus of the Code Collection Authors program, from time to time the RunWhen team may offer one-time "bounty" bonuses in return for specific code bundles built to our specifications and on our clientâ€™s timeframes, e.g. "can anyone build an SLI and TaskSet for AWS SQS next week?"

To take a bounty, go have a look through our [issues](https://github.com/runwhen-contrib/rw-cli-codecollection/issues) marked with the `has bounty` label and assign yourself to the issue (provided it has no other assignees). Bounty size is generally related to the priority labels, indicating that a client may need it asap.

### Royalties

Authors in the program are eligible for royalties from the work they contribute. For more details on the royalties model please reach out to us directly.

### SWAG

Customized hoodies, hats, carabiners, dry erase markers, water bottles, USB drives, AND MORE! Regular contributors receive customized swag so they can proudly promote their contributions to RunWhen!
