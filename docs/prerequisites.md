# Prerequisites

## Prerequisites

This list is currently being updated. Refer to it regularly to ensure you're up-to-date with our prerequisites.

* Have a look at our [contributing doc](contributing.md) if you have not already
* COMING SOON: Sign our CLA
* Review our Code Of Conduct
* Review the Google [python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html); we generally try to follow it but do stray when needed for certain designs.
* Review the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html) docs, although a strong understanding of Robot is not needed. We try to handle complex logic at the python level and use Robot like a configuration language, passing data and settings inbetween python calls.
* You'll need [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to run some of our images. It's possible to do development fully locally out of a container but we can't gauruntee the environment will be well-behaved.
