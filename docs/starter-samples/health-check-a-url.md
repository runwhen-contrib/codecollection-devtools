# Health Check a URL

This approach to checking if a URL is available and timley is demonstrated using a Python & Robot Framework oriented design. In this example we will create a starter codebundle that checks if a URL is available (returning HTTP 200) and has a response latency below a configurable threshold.

* First we write our python function which will be imported as a Robot Keyword; we'll place it in a python file called `checkers.py`

* Here's the source code:

* And the Robot file itself:

We can test this using the `ro` utility tool in the devtools container by running:

`ro runbook.robot`

Output:

And we're done! From here you could look at examining the URL response more closely, provide more detailed output with differing report sections and formats for the platform and users.
