# Introduction

At the heart of our platform and [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free\_and\_open-source\_software) offerings is our community of authors. They play a critical role in curating open source collections of troubleshooting commands that the community can either use directly, through [RunWhen Local](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-local/introduction-runwhen-local), or on our [platform](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/getting-started-with-runwhen-platform) with Engineering Assistants. Our goal is to build the world’s largest open collection of operational code with a level of testing, documentation and metadata that will surpass the libraries at hyperscale companies. It's incredibly challenging - if not impossible - to replicate these multi-thousand person efforts within most companies… but an open source community can.

If any of this sounds interesting to you we'd be excited to have you in the community. Below you'll find a glossary of terms and resources to get started as an author, as well as some details on our rewards program.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to our team on [Slack](https://runwhen.slack.com/join/shared\_invite/zt-1l7t3tdzl-IzB8gXDsWtHkT8C5nufm2A#/shared-invite/email).

### CodeCollections

CodeCollections are version-controlled repositories that follow a consistent file structure and house collections of codebundles which are the core building blocks of functionality across our ecosystem. CodeCollections can be indexed, searched and leveraged by both the [RunWhen Platform](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/getting-started-with-runwhen-platform) and [RunWhen Local](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-local/introduction-runwhen-local), serving as the primary functionality for both.

### CodeBundles

CodeBundles are combinations of source code, metadata, and dynamic configuration that can be used to perform various actions. They most commonly consist of Python, Robot Framework and bash. Codebundles are the basis of SLIs, SLOs and TaskSets on the [platform](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-platform/getting-started-with-runwhen-platform), and for wrapping commands with metadata for use in [RunWhen Local](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-local/introduction-runwhen-local).

### Troubleshooting Commands

At the root of many CodeBundles, are troubleshooting commands wrapped by metadata and configuration. If you've got some troubleshooting commands you keep in your clipboard or personal wiki that you'd like to share, or would like to browse troubleshooting commands for various cloud native products like Vault, Cert Manager, Redis, and Kubernetes then head over to our [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/runwhen-contrib/discussions). Troubleshooting commands can be freely shared and discussed with the community and leveraged by our FOSS tool [RunWhen Local](https://docs.runwhen.com/public/runwhen-local/introduction-runwhen-local) for you and your whole team.

### Contributing

We'd love to collaborate and have you be a part of our community. To get started head over to our [contributing](authors-program-details/contributing.md) doc which also has info for author rewards.
