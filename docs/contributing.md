# Contributing

There are many different ways to contribute to our community which are outlined below. You may also choose to have your work be private to you/your team.

There are three steps in the authors program:

1. Set up a local development environment and get a 'hello world' CodeCollection up and running on your machine.  At this point, you can begin exploring the various Robot/Python libraries we've built or start building your own.
2. Work with a member of the RunWhen team (over slack) to get it published on the platform so it is built in to images and indexed by RunWhen's search.  At this point, your SLIs and TaskSets can be used by anyone on the platform and your open source contributions can be showcased on the platform.
3. &#x20;When ready, work with a member of the RunWhen team about moving your repo to the runwhen-contrib github organization, setting up a regression test environment (provided by RunWhen) and a support agreement.  At this point, you start participating in the revenue share / royalties program.

## Development Process

The documentation and tools here assume the following flow:

1. Set up your CodeCollection repository from the template provided to get started quickly.
2. Set up a local development environment using the RunWhen DevTools container and link it to the CodeCollection repository to get all of the same tools we use in development.
3. Iterate through local development, running your SLI or TaskSet on your local machine until the first CodeBundle is in reasonable shape.  Commit it to your CodeCollection repo and create a tagged v0.0.1 release.
4. Work with a member of the RunWhen team to get your CodeCollection repository registered with the platform.  This includes it in a platform CI/CD pipeline and makes it available for users to configure in their SLXs.
5. Build a test Workspace that shows off the initial capabilities of your CodeCollection.  The RunWhen team can help make this available to all platform users, and help promote it.
6. &#x20;Iterate for your next release.

## Directory Structure

A CodeCollection are laid out in an opinionated directory structure to ensure consistency across the community, a service to your users who may not write CodeBundles but will likely read and audit the source code from many different authors over time.  The docs that follow start with replicating a template repo that we provide.

## DevTools Container

The DevTools Container approach described in "Configuring Your Development Environment" is intended for use with VSCode running locally in a [VS Code / VS Code Server local container topology](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).  Other approaches are in development.

## Coding Standards

While coding standards for Python are well documented, coding standards for Robot Framework are not as well understood.  Docs for those are coming shortly.
